Utility Modules

Molsys is shipped with many scripts you can find useful in your everyday work.

These scripts are given *without any warranty or liability*, so use them *at your risk!* We do not guarantee compatibility with *any* specific version of molsys. That said, we will use best judgement and reasonable effort to keep the code clear and tidy. You are anyway invited to take a look at their source code or ask for help instead of just using scripts blindly.
