 very minimalisitc example to demonstrate the use of an external potential.
The distance between two atoms is restrained to a given distance.

Note that the example external potential class expot_test defined in expot_base.py 
is used here. If you want to design a new external potential please use it
as a starting point. 

This test does not run within pytest!! 
run with 
>>> python test_expot.py
