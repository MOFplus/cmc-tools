Here we use the molecules addon to add 20 benzene molecules to a HKUST1 MOF.

Note that the added molecule must be non-perioic and exactly one chemical molecule

Both MOF and guest have assigned forcefields. In this case also the FFs are merged.

When packmol is installed and in the path (to be called on the shell with packmol < input) 
then it is used to position the guest molecules

Note: we use the pydlpoly convention with the origin of the system in the center of the unit cell.
In other words fractional coords go from -0.5 to +0.5
